This is my workspace for USPSTF AAA Screening test driven development. 

It starts as a copy of cql-test, which hold the testing environment for the completed project USPSTF Diet and Activity for CVD Prevention in Adults FHIRv401. I plan to use this project as a template. 

There is no CQL logic for AAA screening (that I can find) in the CDS Connect repository. Quick google and github searches do not show and publicly available CQL for this guideline. I will take it as an exercise to creat logic and test files for AAA screening, following the CVD Prevention example closely. AAA screening appears to be at Boxwala 1 (Narrative) knowledge level.
