If you know Gordon Lightfoot, you know a little about the story of aortic aneurysms.  Gordon was a Canadian sing-songwriter from the 60s and 70s who had memorable songs such as "If You Could Read My Mind" (1970), "Sundown" (1974), and "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" (1976). 

According to Wikipedia: 

>In September, before the second concert of a two-night stand in Orillia, Lightfoot suffered severe stomach pain and was airlifted to McMaster University Medical Centre in Hamilton, Ontario. He underwent emergency vascular surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, and he remained in serious condition in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Lightfoot endured a six-week coma and a tracheotomy, and he underwent four surgical operations.

Gordon Lightfoot was one of the lucky few to survive a ruptured aortic aneurysm. 

Notable people who did no survive of include [Lucille Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Ball#Death) and [George C. Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Scott). 

Wikpedia describes the abdominal aorta as:

>...the largest artery in the abdominal cavity. As part of the aorta, it is a direct continuation of the descending aorta.

The abdominal aorta begins at the diaphragm, travels down through the abdomen, then divides for form the arteries that travel into the legs, the iliac arteries. It is one of the largest arteries in the human body. 

An aneurysm is a sac-like widening of a blood vessels. The because of this widening, the wall of an aneurysm is weak and prone to rupture. 

It is because the abdominal aorta is such a large vessel that an unrepaired rupture is so deadly. Even when diagnosed and repaired, not everyone survives surgery. For that who do survive, like Gordon Lightfoot, recovery can be slow and difficult.  

These aneurysms do not generally cause symptoms until they rupture. For all of these reasons it is better to detect  and repair them before they rupture. 

This is the rationale behind a practice guideline issued by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USTFPS) [Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Screening](https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening). Two risk factors for these abdominal aortic aneurysms (often abbreviated AAA) are male gender, age and cigarette smoking. This guideline recommends a one-time screening ultrasound to be performed on all men between the ages of 65-75 who ever smoked. 

This guideline is kinda fun to work with because it is so simple. You only need three bits of information (sex, age, smoking history). Unlike pap smears and mammograms -- which require repeated tests over time -- this test is only done once. It's quick, painless, inexpensive test. 

In spite of its simplicity, this guidelines is easily forgotten in a busy primary care office. Many medical insurance companies have pay for performance program that are intended to promote consistent care quality As far as I know there a no pay-for-performance system that reward AAA screening. Studies show that AAA screening rates in the U.S. are [low](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24507825). Computerized reminder systems increase screening rates. This is the rationale behind creating a this computerized reminder systems for detecting AAA. 

This project creates such a reminder in [Clinical Quality Language](https://cql.hl7.org/). This language is often used to create quality measures, it is also used to create point-of-care reminders or 'Decision Support'. Reminders created using this technology can be converted to Clinical Decision Support Hooks [CDS Hooks](https://cds-hooks.org/) and implemented in just about any modern electronic medical record system.
