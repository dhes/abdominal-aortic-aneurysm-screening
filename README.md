This is a clone of AHRQ-CDS/CQL-Testing-Framework by Chris Moesel I have populated the cql and test/cases folders with USPSTF_Diet_and_Activity_for_CVD_Prevention_in_Adults_FHIRv401 logic and data as an educational exercise. This project would more descriptively be called "CQL Testing - USPSTF Diet and Activity for CVD Prevention in Adults FHIRv401", as these are the only logic and testing components included in this repository.
