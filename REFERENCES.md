This is the result of a BARD query. 

>Sure, here are some more specific references about the integration of CDS Hooks or SMART on FHIR into the EMR systems you mentioned:

>* **Allscripts:** Allscripts supports CDS Hooks through its AppExchange marketplace. This marketplace allows developers to create and deploy CDS applications that can be integrated with Allscripts EMR.

>* **eClinicalWorks:** eClinicalWorks supports CDS Hooks through its App Orchard marketplace. This marketplace allows developers to create and deploy CDS applications that can be integrated with eClinicalWorks EMR.

>* **Greenway Health:** Greenway Health supports CDS Hooks through its App Gallery. This gallery allows developers to create and deploy CDS applications that can be integrated with Greenway Health EMR.

>I hope this helps!

So far I have not been able to confirm that any of these apps implements CDS hooks style CDS. It does appear that Practice Fusion implements the SMART on FHIR pattern. Looking into this distracts me to:

Notable quote: 'We are unaware of any commercial EHRs that currently support CQL for real-time, patient-specific, locally developed CDS that is outside of the population health management or quality measurement domains.'
