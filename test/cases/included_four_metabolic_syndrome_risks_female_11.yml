    You may be at risk for (in other words, more likely to have) heart disease
    or a stroke based upon risk factors you may have.


    Risk factors include high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol (the “bad”
    kind of cholesterol), low HDL cholesterol (the “good” kind), high
    Triglycerides, high blood sugar, or too much weight around your middle.

    Experts (i.e., [The U.S. Preventive Services Task
    Force](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/about-the-uspstf))
    find that one way to lower the risk of heart disease and stroke is through
    counseling and coaching programs that help you eat healthy foods and
    increase your physical activity (exercise and movement). These programs
    typically involve a trained counselor who can teach you, help you set goals,
    share ways to eat a healthy diet and increase physical activity and
    regularly follow up with you.


    Contact your doctor to discuss whether coaching and counseling are right for
    you.


    In addition, the experts know that all adults, whether they are at an
    increased risk for heart disease and stroke or not, can improve their health
    through healthy eating and being more physically active.
